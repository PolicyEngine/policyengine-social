        üéâ Exciting news: @NSF has awarded PolicyEngine a $300,000 Phase I grant through their Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program!
        
        This grant will help us strengthen the open-source ecosystem around economic policy analysis tools.
        
        üßµ Here's what we'll be doing:

        Our grant activities focus on three key areas:
        
        üî¨ Ecosystem Discovery: 100+ stakeholder interviews with researchers, government agencies, and nonprofits
        
        ü§ù Community Building: Developing partnerships and creating resources for contributors
        
        üèõÔ∏è Governance: Building sustainable structures for growth

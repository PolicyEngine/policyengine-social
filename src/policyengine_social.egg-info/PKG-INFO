# PolicyEngine Social Media Automation

Automated social media posting for PolicyEngine blog articles and announcements.

## Features

- 🤖 Auto-generates social posts from blog articles
- 🐦 Posts to X (Twitter) with thread support
- 💼 Posts to LinkedIn with professional formatting
- 📊 Tracks engagement and analytics
- ✅ Review process via GitHub PRs
- 📅 Scheduling and timezone optimization

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up GitHub Secrets (see below)
3. Posts are automatically created when blog posts are merged

## How it Works

1. When a new blog post is published to `policyengine-app`, a GitHub Action triggers
2. The action creates a draft social media post as a PR in this repo
3. Team reviews and edits the content
4. Upon merge, posts are automatically published to X and LinkedIn
5. Analytics are tracked and reported back as GitHub issues

## Repository Structure

```
posts/
├── queue/         # Posts waiting to be published
├── published/     # Archive of published posts
└── drafts/        # Work in progress

templates/         # Reusable post templates
scripts/          # Automation scripts
.github/
└── workflows/    # GitHub Actions
```

## Required Secrets

Set these in your repository settings:

- `X_API_KEY` - X/Twitter API credentials
- `X_API_SECRET`
- `X_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `X_ACCESS_SECRET`
- `LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN` - LinkedIn API token
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - For cross-repo access (auto-provided)

## Post Format

Posts are stored as YAML files with platform-specific content:

```yaml
title: "Post Title"
source: "blog/article-slug"
publish_at: "2024-08-19T10:00:00-05:00"  # Optional scheduling
platforms:
  x:
    thread:
      - "First tweet with engaging hook"
      - "Second tweet with details"
    media: ["image1.png"]
  linkedin:
    text: "Professional summary..."
    media: ["image1.png"]
```

## Usage

### Manual Trigger

To manually create a social post for a blog article:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Create Social Post from Blog"
3. Enter the blog slug
4. Review and merge the generated PR

### Automatic Trigger

Posts are automatically created when:
- A new blog post is merged to `policyengine-app`
- The post includes social media metadata
